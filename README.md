# Baj's Tower Defense Framework

Tower Defense framework that frees you from optimization hell and lets you create what you want to create

</div>

Devforum page is unavailable

If you use this framework in your games, consider giving the repo a star and donating to my broke ass

## What this framework handles:
- Server data structure: Towers, enemies, paths
- Towers: placement, upgrades, status effects
- Enemies: health, speed, walking along path
- Paths: normal, bezier, split
- API endpoints

## What this framework does not handle:
**Game logic**,
UI,
Lobbies,
Player data apart from money

If you want a template of those, you can find them in the demo place (will be available soon™️)

## Features:
TBD
- Lightweight: performance-heavy computations are thoroughly optimized and run in parallel
- Easy to set up new towers
- Easy to set up new enemies
- Easy to create* enemy paths
- Extremely customizable, but stays user-friendly
- Full documentation with clear examples

\* with a plugin
