# Baj's Tower Defense Framework

blazingly fast framework made with ease of use in mind

</div>

Devforum page is unavailable

If you use this framework in your games, consider giving the repo a star and donating to my broke ass

## What this framework handles:
- Server data structure: Towers, enemies, paths
- Towers: stats, placement, upgrades, attacks, animations, stat effects
- Enemies: health, speed, animations, walking along path
- Paths: normal, bezier, split
- API endpoints: events, stat checks

## What this framework does not handle:
UI,
Lobbies,
Player data apart from money

If you want a template of those, you can find them in the demo place (will be available once this framework is done)

## Features:
TBD
- VERY performant (800 enemies & 6 towers resulted in under 20% server load)
- Easy to set up new towers
- Easy to set up new enemies
- Easy to create* enemy paths
- Extremely customizable, but stays user-friendly
- Full documentation with clear examples

\* with a plugin
